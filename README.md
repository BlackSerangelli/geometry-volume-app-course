# geometry-volume-app-course

## Project Description
A simple geometry volume calculator that computes volumes for different geometric shapes including boxes, cylinders, spheres, and cones.

## Project Structure

* **geometry/**: Folder that contains the different geometric figure volume calculations
* **tests/**: Folder that contains validations for the volume of each geometric figure
* **main.py**: Main program that allows the user to interact with the different geometric figures, where the user provides certain parameters and receives the calculated volume

## How to Run main.py

Run the interactive menu from the **root directory** and type the next command in the terminal:
```bash
python main.py
```

## How to Run Tests

Run the unit tests from **root directory** by typing the following command in the terminal:
```bash
pytest
```

## Dependencies
* Python 3.x
* pytest
